    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this course, we will discuss sea level rise extensively. Many people live near present-day sea level (e.g., Nicholls et al., 2008), and rises in sea level expose these people to the possibility of flooding. For example, the ongoing increase in sea level will likely cause communities on the United States’ eastern coast to experience frequent flooding within the next few decades ([Spanger-Siegfried et al., 2014](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/encroaching-tides#.V1rbxb4rJBw)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Sea level rise is caused by temperature increases, which in turn are driven by increases in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is produced by human activities and natural processes. Increases in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere enhance the trapping of infrared radiation near the Earth’s surface and contribute to rises in surface air temperatures. As the ocean absorbs some of the excess heat from the atmosphere, its temperature increases, causing it to expand and causing sea level rise. Temperature increases cause melt of glaciers and ice sheets, which leads to sea level rise by adding mass to the oceans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data covering the last century support this relationship between atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, temperature, and sea level (Fig. 1). The curves in the three panels of Figure 1 rise together, suggesting that these variables are related. Although correlation does not prove causation, the combination of a clear relationship between variables with a plausible explanation for why they should be related is a strong argument for causation.\n",

    "> </div>\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Figure 1:** Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations (top panel), surface air temperature change (middle panel), and sea level change (bottom panel), between 1900 and ~2015. All three quantities rise over this period, suggesting a causal relationship between them. See text for discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequent, accurate measurements of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere began in the late 1950s at Mauna Loa in Hawaii (Keeling et al., 1976; blue curve in Fig. 1, top panel). These measurements show an annual cycle that represents Northern Hemisphere seasons. Plants lose their leaves or die during the winter, releasing carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The Northern Hemisphere has much more land, and therefore more plants, than the Southern Hemisphere. Thus, the Northern Hemisphere’s seasons largely control the variability in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations within any individual year. However, there is a definite upward trend in this curve that is larger than the amplitude of the annual cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurements of former atmospheric compositions from bubbles trapped in ice cores allow us to extend the observational record of carbon dioxide concentrations farther back in time (MacFarling Meure et al., 2006; black curve in Fig. 1, top panel). As snow falls on the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, it traps samples of the atmosphere. Because new snow buries and compresses old snow, the time at which different snow samples fell can be estimated by counting the layers in an ice sheet. The ice core measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are less finely resolved in time than the direct measurements, and therefore don’t reflect the annual cycle of CO2 in the atmosphere. However, the trend of the ice core data is similar to that of the direct observations during the period when they overlap, suggesting that the ice core data are reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because carbon dioxide mixes readily in the atmosphere, measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations at most places on the Earth’s surface are relatively representative of the globe as a whole. In contrast, both surface air temperatures and sea levels are measured at widely dispersed stations and must be aggregated to give a global mean value. Global mean temperatures must be estimated from individual weather stations with long records (Hansen et al., 2010); past sea levels are estimated using data from tide gages (Jevrejeva et al., 2014). As one might expect, there are various methods for performing this aggregation, and the different methods give somewhat different answers. However, it seems clear that both global mean surface air temperature and global mean sea level are rising.\n",

    "In this lab exercise, you'll work with the data files needed to make the top two panels of Figure 1. You'll then modify your code so that it plots all three panels of Figure 1."
